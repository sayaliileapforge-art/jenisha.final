# Dynamic Document Fields - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Admin Portal (React)
- **Fixed Firestore Save Logic**: Document fields are now saved to `services/{serviceId}` document with `documentFields` array
- **Single Source of Truth**: Firestore services collection is the primary data source
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect instantly via Firestore listeners

### ✅ Flutter Mobile App
- **Real-time Listener**: Added `getServiceDocumentFieldsStream()` to listen to service document fields
- **Dynamic Form Renderer**: Builds UI dynamically based on field types:
  - **Text/Number/Date**: TextFormField with appropriate keyboard types
  - **Image/PDF**: File picker with upload to Hostinger
- **Hostinger Image Upload**: Files upload to `https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/upload_document.php`
- **Smart Validation**: Checks all required fields before allowing submission
- **Unified Storage**: All field values (text or image URLs) saved to Firestore `applications` collection

### ✅ Firestore Structure

```
services/{serviceId}
├── name
├── categoryId
├── documentFields: [
│     {
│       id: "field_123",
│       name: "Aadhaar Number",
│       type: "text",
│       required: true,
│       placeholder: "Enter 12-digit number"
│     },
│     {
│       id: "field_124",
│       name: "Aadhaar Photo",
│       type: "image",
│       required: true,
│       placeholder: ""
│     }
│   ]
└── updatedAt

applications/{userId_serviceId}
├── serviceId
├── userId
├── fullName
├── mobile
├── email
├── documents: {
│     field_123: "123456789012",
│     field_124: "https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/documents/doc_123.jpg"

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Step 1: Admin Portal - Add Dynamic Fields

1. **Open Admin Portal**: `http://localhost:5173` (or your admin URL)
2. **Navigate to**: Document Requirements → Dynamic Fields
3. **Select a Service**: Click on any service (e.g., "correction card")
4. **Add Fields**:
   - Click "Add Field"
   - Set Field Name: "Aadhaar Number"
   - Set Type: "Text"
   - Set Placeholder: "Enter 12-digit number"
   - Check "Required"
   - Click "Add Field" again
   - Set Field Name: "Aadhaar Photo"
   - Set Type: "Image"
   - Check "Required"
5. **Save**: Click "Save Fields"

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Console shows: `Document fields saved to services/{serviceId}`
- ✅ Firestore updates instantly

### Step 2: Flutter App - View Real-time Update

1. **Open Flutter App** (if already open on service form, go back and re-enter)
2. **Navigate**: Home → Select same service
3. **Observe**:
   - Fields appear instantly WITHOUT app restart
   - "Aadhaar Number" shows as text input
   - "Aadhaar Photo" shows as upload button

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Fields visible immediately
- ✅ "No documents required" message disappears
- ✅ Submit button is disabled until all required fields filled

### Step 3: Flutter App - Fill Text Field

1. **Enter Text**: Type "123456789012" in "Aadhaar Number"
2. **Observe Submit Button**: Should still be disabled (image not uploaded)

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Text input works smoothly
- ✅ Submit stays disabled

### Step 4: Flutter App - Upload Image

1. **Click**: "Upload Image" button for "Aadhaar Photo"
2. **Select**: Pick an image from gallery
3. **Wait**: Upload progress shows
4. **Observe**:
   - Image preview appears
   - Green checkmark shows
   - Submit button becomes enabled

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Image uploads to Hostinger
- ✅ Preview shows uploaded image
- ✅ Submit button enabled

### Step 5: Flutter App - Submit Application

1. **Fill**: Full Name and Mobile Number
2. **Click**: "Submit Application"
3. **Check Firestore**: `applications/{userId_serviceId}`

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "serviceId": "service_123",
  "userId": "user_abc",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "mobile": "9876543210",
  "documents": {
    "field_123": "123456789012",
    "field_124": "https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/documents/doc_1234567890.jpg"
  },
  "status": "pending",
  "submittedAt": "2026-02-09T..."
}
```

### Step 6: Admin Portal - Modify Fields (Live Test)

1. **Keep Flutter App Open** on service form screen
2. **In Admin Portal**: 
   - Add a new field: "Pan Card Number" (Text, Required)
   - Click "Save Fields"
3. **Switch to Flutter App**:
   - New field appears instantly WITHOUT refresh!

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ New field appears in real-time
- ✅ Submit button disables again (new required field empty)
- ✅ No app restart needed

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Hostinger PHP Files
Ensure these files are deployed to Hostinger in `/public_html/uploads/`:
- ✅ `upload_document.php` - Handles dynamic field uploads
- ✅ `upload_banner.php` - Handles banner uploads
- ✅ `upload_logo.php` - Handles category logo uploads

### Flutter App Build
```bash
cd jenisha_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Admin Portal Build
```bash
cd admn
npm install
npm run dev    # Development
npm run build  # Production
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No documents required" shows even after adding fields

**Solution**:
1. Check Admin console for save confirmation
2. Verify Firestore: `services/{serviceId}` has `documentFields` array
3. Verify Flutter console shows: `"📋 Subscribing to document fields..."`

### Issue: Upload fails

**Solution**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify Hostinger endpoint: `https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/upload_document.php`
3. Check Flutter console for detailed error
4. Ensure file size < 10MB

### Issue: Fields don't update in real-time

**Solution**:
1. Ensure Flutter is using `StreamBuilder` with `getServiceDocumentFieldsStream()`
2. Check Firestore console - verify `documentFields` array updates
3. Restart Flutter app if necessary
