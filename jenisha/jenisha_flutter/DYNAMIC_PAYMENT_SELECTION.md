# 💳 Dynamic Payment Method Selection - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Payment Method Enum
```dart
enum PaymentMethod {
  upi,
  card,
  netbanking,
  wallet,
}
```

### 2. State Management
- `PaymentMethod? _selectedMethod` - Tracks user's selection
- Form controllers for each payment method (UPI ID, Card details, Bank, Wallet)
- Dynamic UI rendering based on selection

### 3. Selectable Payment Method Buttons
- Four interactive buttons: UPI, Cards, NetBanking, Wallets
- Visual feedback:
  - Selected: Blue border, blue background, checkmark icon
  - Unselected: Gray border, light gray background
- Tapping updates `_selectedMethod`

### 4. Dynamic Form Fields

#### **UPI Selection:**
- TextField for UPI ID (e.g., `yourname@upi`)
- Info text: "Razorpay will redirect you to your UPI app"

#### **Card Selection:**
- Card Number (19 digits max)
- Card Holder Name
- Expiry Date (MM/YY format)
- CVV (3 digits, obscured)
- Security badge: "🔒 Secure: Final card entry in Razorpay gateway"

#### **NetBanking Selection:**
- Dropdown with major banks:
  - State Bank of India
  - HDFC Bank
  - ICICI Bank
  - Axis Bank
  - Punjab National Bank
  - And more...
- Info text: "You will be redirected to your bank's secure login"

#### **Wallet Selection:**
- Selectable wallet provider chips:
  - Paytm
  - PhonePe
  - Google Pay
  - Amazon Pay
  - Mobikwik
- Visual selection feedback with checkmark
- Info text: "Razorpay will open your selected wallet app"

### 5. Validation Logic

**Before payment processing:**
- ✅ Check if payment method selected
- ✅ UPI: Validate UPI ID entered
- ✅ Card: Validate all 4 fields filled
- ✅ NetBanking: Validate bank selected
- ✅ Wallet: Validate wallet provider selected

**If validation fails:** Show error message and prevent payment

### 6. Razorpay Integration

Updated `PaymentService.openCheckout()`:
```dart
await _paymentService.openCheckout(
  amount: _registrationFee,
  userEmail: _userEmail,
  userPhone: _userPhone,
  userName: _userName,
  description: 'Agent Registration Fee',
  preferredMethod: 'upi' // or 'card', 'netbanking', 'wallet'
);
```

Razorpay options now include:
```dart
'method': {
  'upi': preferredMethod == 'upi',
  'card': preferredMethod == 'card',
  'netbanking': preferredMethod == 'netbanking',
  'wallet': preferredMethod == 'wallet',
}
```

This tells Razorpay to:
- Open directly to the selected payment method
- Skip method selection screen
- Show UPI/Card/NetBanking/Wallet UI first

### 7. Security Implementation

**✅ PRODUCTION SAFE:**
- Card details entered in UI are **NOT processed locally**
- All form fields are **preview/validation only**
- Actual payment processing happens in **Razorpay SDK**
- No sensitive data stored or transmitted by our app
- Razorpay handles all PCI-DSS compliance

**Flow:**
1. User fills fields in our UI (validation/UX only)
2. User clicks "Pay Now"
3. Our app calls `Razorpay.open()` with preferred method
4. Razorpay modal opens
5. **User enters actual payment details in Razorpay's secure form**
6. Payment processed by Razorpay
7. Success/failure callback to our app

### 8. UI/UX Features

**AnimatedSwitcher:**
- Smooth 300ms transition when changing payment methods
- Fields fade in/out elegantly

**Button States:**
- "Pay Now" button disabled if:
  - No payment method selected
  - Payment is processing
- Shows gray background when disabled
- Shows loading spinner when processing

**Error Handling:**

- Errors clear when user selects a method

**Visual Feedback:**

- Hover effects on all buttons
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Responsive layout

### 9. User Flow

1. **User views payment screen**
   - Sees 4 payment method buttons
   - All are unselected (gray)
   - "Pay Now" button is disabled

2. **User selects UPI**
   - UPI button turns blue with checkmark
   - UPI ID field appears below with animation
   - Info text shows what will happen

3. **User enters UPI ID**

   - "Pay Now" button becomes enabled

4. **User clicks "Pay Now"**
   - Validation passes

   - Success → Navigate to Documents step
