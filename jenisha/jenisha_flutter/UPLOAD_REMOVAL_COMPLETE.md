  - Document URL fields (now set to empty strings `""`)
  - Registration Status
  - Timestamps

## Notes for Development Team

### **What Happens Now:**
- Users can register and apply for services **without uploading any documents**
- All user information is saved to **Firestore**
- Document URL fields in Firestore are set to **empty strings** `""`
- Firebase Storage service is **not used** anymore

### **Future Considerations:**
- If document uploads are re-enabled in the future, the `firebase_storage_service.dart` and `document_upload_service.dart` can be reused
- The Firestore schema already has fields for document URLs (`aadhaarCardUrl`, `panCardUrl`)
- No data migration is needed - existing user profiles will continue to work

### **Files Safe to Delete (Optional):**
```
lib/services/firebase_storage_service.dart
lib/services/document_upload_service.dart
lib/services/document_preview_service.dart
```

These are deprecated and unused but have been left for reference.
