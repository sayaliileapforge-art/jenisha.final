### Client-Side (Flutter) - Dart Files

#### FILES UPDATED
| File | Changes | Purpose |

#### KEY FEATURES ADDED
```dart
// Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Attempt 1: Immediate (wait 0s)
- Attempt 2: After 2 second delay
- Attempt 3: After 4 second delay

// Timeout handling: 60 seconds per attempt
- File read timeout: 30s
- Upload timeout: 60s
- Response read timeout: 30s

// Error classification
- Transient errors (retry): Connection reset, timeouts, 408/502/504
- Permanent errors (fail fast): Invalid MIME, file not found, 400/401

// Detailed logging
✓ Attempt number and progress
✓ File size and type
✓ URL being contacted
✓ Response status and body
✓ Exact error messages
```

## 📊 Upload System Architecture (Now Working)

```
Flutter App (Mobile)
    ↓
DocumentUploadService.uploadDocument()
    ↓[Retry Logic: 3 attempts, 60s timeout]
    ↓
HTTP POST: https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/upload.php
    ├─ Field: userId = [Firebase User ID]
    ├─ Field: documentId = "adhaar" or "pan"
    └─ File: image binary data
    ↓
Server: upload.php
    ├─ Validate: userId, documentId, file
    ├─ Validate: File size (≤5MB), MIME type (image/*)
    ├─ Auto-create: /uploads/users/
    ├─ Auto-create: /uploads/users/{userId}/
    ├─ Save file: /uploads/users/{userId}/{documentId}.jpg
    ├─ Verify: File exists and readable
    ├─ Log: All steps to upload.log
    └─ Return: {"success": true, "imageUrl": "https://..."}
    ↓
Flutter receives imageUrl
    ↓
FirestoreService.saveUserDocumentUrl()
    ↓
Firestore: users/{uid}/documents/{documentId} = imageUrl
    ↓
Admin Panel reads from Firestore
    ↓
Browser displays: [View Document] links with images
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Everything Works

### Quick 10-Minute Test

1. **Server Status (2 min)**
   ```
   Visit: https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/status.php
   Verify: All items show YES/Enabled
   ```

2. **Test Upload (3 min)**
   ```
   Visit: https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/test_suite.php
   Click: "Upload Test Image"
   Verify: Upload succeeds
   ```

3. **Flutter App (3 min)**
   ```
   flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run
   Go to: Documents step in registration form
   Upload: Aadhaar image
   Verify: Success, no errors in logs
   ```

4. **Admin Panel (2 min)**

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem #1: Missing Directory
- **Before:** `/uploads/users/` didn't exist → move_uploaded_file() failed silently
- **After:** Auto-created with proper permissions on first upload

### Problem #2: Silent Failures
- **Before:** No logs → couldn't diagnose failure
- **After:** Comprehensive logging every step → exact failure point identified

### Problem #3: No Retry Logic
- **Before:** Network timeout → immediate failure
- **After:** Automatic retry (3 times, exponential backoff 2s/4s delays)

### Problem #4: Timeout Handling
- **Before:** Default ~30s timeout → connection reset
- **After:** 60s timeout per attempt, with retry logic

### Problem #5: Poor Error Messages
- **Before:** Generic error → user has no idea what failed
- **After:** Specific errors: "File exceeds 5MB", "Directory not writable", etc.

## 🚨 If Something Still Doesn't Work

### Diagnostic Workflow

1. **Check status.php**
   - All items YES? → Go to step 2
   - Something NO? → Contact hosting support

2. **Check test_suite.php results**
   - Upload succeeds? → Go to step 3
   - Upload fails? → Check error message and upload.log

3. **Check Flutter logs**
   - Success shown? → Go to step 4
   - Errors shown? → Check upload.log on server

4. **Check Admin Panel**
   - Images show? → ✅ All working
   - No images? → Check Firestore has URLs

5. **Check upload.log**
   - Recent entries shown? → Requests reaching server
   - What errors logged? → Specific issue identified
