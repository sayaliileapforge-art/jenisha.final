**Time to verify:** ~10 minutes
**Status:** All fixes applied to server
**Next:** Test and verify everything works

---

## ⚡ Quick Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Server Configuration (2 min)

1. Open this URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/status.php
   ```

2. Look for these items - all should show **YES** or **Enabled**:
   ```
   ✓ file_uploads: Enabled
   ✓ /uploads exists: YES
   ✓ /uploads writable: YES
   ✓ /uploads/users exists: YES
   ✓ /uploads/users writable: YES
   ✓ Can write to /uploads/users: YES
   ```

3. **If any show NO:**
   - Contact Hostinger support
   - Say you need chmod 755 on `/uploads/` and `/uploads/users/`
   - Wait for them to fix and re-check

---

### Step 2: Test Upload Mechanism (3 min)

1. Open this URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/test_suite.php
   ```

2. Click buttons in order:

   **Button 1: "Check Uploads"**
   - Should show: `"Total files": 0` (no uploads yet)
   
   **Button 2: "Upload Test Image"**
   - Select any image file from your computer
   - Click "Upload Test Image"
   - Expected response:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true,
       "imageUrl": "https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/users/test_1234567890/adhaar.jpg",
       ...
     }
     ```
   
   **Button 3: "Check Uploads" again**
   - Should now show: `"Total files": 1`
   - Should show your uploaded file listed

3. **If any test fails:**
   - Check the error message carefully
   - Copy the error and search for it in `/ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` section "If Upload Still Fails"

### Step 3: Test Flutter App (2 min)

1. On your phone/emulator, rebuild the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. Open the app and go to: **Registration Form → Documents Step**

3. Try uploading Aadhaar image:
   - Click "Pick Image" → Select from Gallery/Camera
   - Should see success message
   - NO "Connection reset" error in logs

4. Monitor logs:
   ```bash
   flutter logs | grep UPLOAD
   ```
   
   Look for: ✅ Success messages
   Avoid: ❌ Connection errors or 3 failed attempts

---

### Step 4: Verify Admin Panel (1 min)

1. Open Admin Panel: `https://your-domain.com/admn/`

2. Find the agent whose documents you uploaded

3. Check:
   - [ ] "View Document" link appears for Aadhaar
   - [ ] Click it → Image loads correctly
   - [ ] Same for PAN card

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Check | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| status.php shows NO for items | Permissions | Contact Hostinger - request chmod 755 |
| Test upload fails with error | upload.log | Read error message in status check |
| Upload timeout (60 seconds) | Network | Has retry logic now - should recover |
| Connection reset error in Flutter logs | Server logs | Check /uploads/upload.log for details |
| Admin panel shows no document | Firestore | Check if imageUrl saved to Firestore |
| Document link broken | Image URL | URL should be in status check upload list |

## 📊 What's Different Now

### Before
- ❌ Images don't upload
- ❌ No error messages
- ❌ Timeouts = immediate failure
- ❌ No way to diagnose

### After ✅
- ✅ Auto-creates upload directories
- ✅ Logs every step in upload.log
- ✅ Retries up to 3 times (2s, 4s delays)
- ✅ Detailed error messages
- ✅ Test endpoints for verification
- ✅ Complete documentation

## 📞 Need Help?

### Gather Information
1. Run `status.php` - screenshot
2. Run `test_suite.php` - screenshot of results
3. Check `/uploads/upload.log` - last 10 lines
4. Flutter logs: `flutter logs | grep UPLOAD` (last 20 lines)

### Common Solutions
- **All status checks failing?** → Contact hosting support for permissions
- **Test upload fails?** → Check error in /uploads/upload.log
- **Flutter upload still fails?** → Check retry logic is running (look for multiple attempts in logs)
- **Admin panel doesn't show image?** → Verify Firestore has the imageUrl saved

## 🎯 Expected Results

### In /uploads/users/
```
users/
├── abc123def456/              ← User ID
│   ├── adhaar.jpg             ← Aadhaar document
│   └── pan.jpg                ← PAN document
└── xyz789uvw012/              ← Another user
    ├── adhaar.jpg
    └── pan.jpg
```

### In Firestore (users collection)
```
uid: "abc123def456"
documents: {
  adhaar: "https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/users/abc123def456/adhaar.jpg",
  pan: "https://cyan-llama-839264.hostingersite.com/uploads/users/abc123def456/pan.jpg"
}
```

### In Admin Panel
```
Aadhaar: [View Document] ← clicks to show image
PAN Card: [View Document] ← clicks to show image
```

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Retry logic is automatic** - if timeout, app waits 2-4 seconds and tries again
2. **No manual retry needed** - app handles it internally
3. **Logs are your friend** - always check /uploads/upload.log if something unexpected
4. **Test endpoints are kept** - use them anytime to verify system working
